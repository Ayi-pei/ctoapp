## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #63B3ED (RGB), a calm, professional blue suitable for finance apps, drawn from the original 'primary' CSS variable but modified to be slightly less saturated. Background color: #0C1424 (RGB), very dark blue to maintain dark theme and readability. Accent color: #D08770 (RGB), an analogous peach hue to the primary, for important elements like call-to-action buttons, promoting a sense of trust and stability.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, known for its clean, modern appearance and excellent readability on screens.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons from Font Awesome to represent different cryptocurrencies, order types, and UI elements.
- Implement a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, with a clear separation of main content (charts, order form) and sidebar (order book, trade history).
- Incorporate subtle animations for UI transitions and data updates to enhance user experience without being distracting.
